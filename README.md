# hft-efpga-ops

HFT-specialized operators for the group's synthesized eFPGA fabric (Fabric-to-Silicon).

The first operator is a fixed-point **divider** — the base unit for the HFT signal path, where operations such as microprice and order-book imbalance bottleneck on division.

## Environment (ECE Numbers cluster)

Tools live in scratch and are on `PATH` via `~/.bash_profile`.

| Tool | Location / Notes |
|------|-------------------|
| **Yosys** | OSS CAD Suite in `/scratch/$USER/oss-cad-suite` |
| **VPR** | VTR built from source at commit `7a9676256` (matches the arch/FASM format) |
| **iverilog** | Comes with the OSS CAD Suite (used for RTL verification) |

Clone the repository with the submodule:

```sh
git clone --recursive <repo>
```

---

## Run the eFPGA flow (`custdiv` tile → Yosys + VPR)

```sh
cd flow/custdiv_test
source design.sh

cd yosys
make synth

cd ../vpr_pnr
make vpr      # expect "VPR succeeded"
```

---

## Run the divider verification

### Using the Makefile

```sh
cd verif
make          # expect "ALL PASS"
```

### Manual invocation

```sh
cd verif
iverilog -g2012 -o sim ../rtl/divider.sv test_divider.sv
vvp sim
```

## Status

- ✅ `custdiv` tile defined in the eFPGA architecture; packs, places, and routes successfully through VPR.
- ✅ 32-bit fixed-point radix-2 restoring divider (`rtl/divider.sv`).
- ✅ Verified against SystemVerilog `/` and `%` over directed edge cases and 1000 random vectors.
